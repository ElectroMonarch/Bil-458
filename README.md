## Project Description
This project implements a **Spiral Matrix** generator in C#. The program takes an integer `n` as input and generates an `n x n` matrix filled with numbers in a spiral order.

## How to Run
### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (for compiling and running C# programs)
- A C# compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or CLI tools)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone -b develop https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```sh
   csc SpiralMatrix.cs
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   SpiralMatrix.exe
   ```
5. Enter the size of the matrix when prompted.

## Code Explanation
- The program initializes a 2D array of size `n x n`.
- It fills the matrix in a spiral order using four boundaries: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`.
- The numbers are inserted sequentially until the matrix is filled.
- The final matrix is displayed in a formatted manner.

## GitHub Requirements
- The code is committed and pushed to the **develop branch**.
- Commit message: `Yağız Akın BAŞTOPÇU`

## Example Output
```
Enter the size of the matrix: 5
 1   2   3   4   5
16  17  18  19   6
15  24  25  20   7
